## Run the program

In order to run the program, you first need to install `requirements.txt`. Next, you simply run `python main.py`.

**Note:** You can change the iteration or number of inputs in  `DnnTestSuit.py` file. In order to re-train the model, you also need to change number of iterations in `main.py` to the same number you set for number of inputs in `DnnTestSuit.py` file.
